        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>Hello dear students, surely few of you will get to this section, and much less you will read it,
            we just want to tell you that we love what we do, that is, teaching, and that when you are lucky
            enough to be able to dedicate yourself to what you like at the end the work becomes a kind of hobby.
            Even so, if you still want to know a little more about our work and objectives, it is nothing more
            than helping you achieve your goals academically. Our private English and math classes cover all
            levels and are focused on helping you learn and pass.
        </p>
